# Solidity-Smart-Contracts
smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. My smart contract will use Ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
